xterm-256color
this means that the terminal CAN display color
not what settings it currently has
what I'd like is to check whether, eg, the terminal has only all green outputting in which case the colors will be useless from the wordle defaults



https://pypi.org/project/colorama/

print('\033[31m' + 'some red text')
print('\033[39m') # and reset to default color

like great that we can change to default, but how can I act depending on value of it? I guess I'll have tomanually create a bg and fg colorset





colorama refers us also to:
https://pypi.org/project/blessings/




so what if intsead of G and Y, I used <CORRECT LETTER> and <almost correct>
i.e. caps/lower
